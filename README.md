**Lead Scoring Case Study**

**Overview**

This repository contains a complete solution for the Lead Scoring Case Study. The aim of this project is to predict lead conversion likelihood and optimize business strategies using machine learning techniques, specifically Logistic Regression.

**Objective**
1. Identify key factors influencing lead conversions.
2. Develop a lead scoring system to prioritize leads and improve conversion rates.
3. Provide actionable business insights for better marketing and sales decision-making.

**Steps Followed**
1. **Data Cleaning and Preparation**
   
   i. Handled missing values and removed unnecessary columns.
   
   ii. Encoded categorical variables and scaled numerical features for model performance.
  
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   
   i. Visualized relationships between features and conversion rates using heatmaps and boxplots.
   
   ii. Identified key metrics such as Total Time Spent on Website and Last Activity influencing conversions.

5. **Model Development**
   
   i.Used Logistic Regression for its interpretability and efficiency.
   
   ii. Applied Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) to select the most important predictors.

7. **Model Evaluation**
   
   i. Evaluated the model using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and AUC-ROC.
   
   ii. Achieved reliable performance suitable for lead scoring.

9. **Insights and Recommendations**
    
   i. Prioritize leads with high engagement metrics for targeted follow-ups.
   
   ii. Monitor features like Lead Origin and Last Activity to streamline sales efforts.

**Key Learnings**

 a. Data preprocessing and feature selection play a vital role in improving model performance.  
 b. Engagement metrics like time spent on the website are strong predictors of lead conversions.  
 c. Logistic Regression is an effective and interpretable solution for business use cases like lead scoring.  
 d. GitHub for version control and collaboration
